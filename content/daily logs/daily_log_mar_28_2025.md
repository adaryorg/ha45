10k race<br>

## Training notes
A very challenging race, that was very different from my regular running training with very little elevation. First five kilometers were mostly downhill, with two very short climbs, which made the second half of the race very challenging. Overall time was slower than I hoped for, but I finished, and enjoyed the race a lot. In any case i participated in this one for fun while training for 21.1km somewhere in May this year.
