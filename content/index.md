# Welcome to Healthy After 45
Two and a half years ago I was everything but healthy. I was 47 years old, I was severely overweight (or rather morbidly obese), my type 2 diabetes was in an uncontrolled rage, and everything was going downhill. So here is the tl;dr version: I was in a very bad place, I almost died, and since I have quite a few reasons to stay alive, I took control of my health, my weight, and applied my extremely nerdy data driven approach to everything.

This site is my personal log of exercise,  daily nutrition, and overall tracking trends in my overall health. I might occasionally write a rant or two so if anyone is interested, be my guest.
