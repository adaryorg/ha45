# Welcome to Healthy After 45

![[images/ta_marathon.jpg|right| 300]] Two and a half years ago I was everything but healthy. I was 47 years old, I was severely overweight (or rather morbidly obese), my type 2 diabetes was in an uncontrolled rage, and everything was going downhill. So here is the tl;dr version: I was in a very bad place, I almost died, and since I have quite a few reasons to stay alive, I took control of my health, my weight, and applied my extremely nerdy data driven approach to everything.<br>
Again tl;dr: Two and a half years later i'm not morbidly obese anymore, quite the opposite. My diabetes is in full remission, and i've never been healthier. I also started running, going to the gym at least two times a week, and eating very healthy (I will write a lot more on these topics soon)<br>
I will use this site to log my progress, keep track of everything, and occasionally make geeky graphs that should make sense to me. If something like this is your cup of tea, welcome!
